    <h2>Guess the Number</h2>
    <p>"Guess the Number" is a simple Python game where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it. After each attempt, the program provides hints—whether the guess is too high or too low—until the correct number is guessed. It's a great way to learn basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling."</p>

        <h2>slideshow</h2>
    <p>simple slideshow using the tkinter library. It loads images from a folder called images, cycles through them using itertools.cycle, and updates the displayed image every two seconds with the after method. The use of Label to show images and PhotoImage to handle them in the GUI is a classic approach in tkinter.</p>

        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
    <p>"Tic-Tac-Toe" is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with either 'X' or 'O'. The objective is to be the first to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game can end in a win for one player or a draw if all spaces are filled without a winner.
